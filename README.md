# 📌 AI-Organized YouTube Comment Layer with Real-Time Video Context

### 🎯 Problem Statement

YouTube's current comment section lacks dynamic interactivity with the video playback, making it hard for users to discover relevant comments tied to specific moments. The traditional comment layout often leads to clutter, distraction, and a poor user experience—especially on smaller screens.

### 💡 Proposed Solution

This project proposes a **redesigned YouTube comment experience**, introducing an **AI-Organized Comment Layer** that dynamically adapts to real-time video context. It restructures the comment section into a more **engaging, accessible, and time-relevant interface**, ultimately enhancing user interaction and engagement.

### 🔍 Focus Areas

- ⚡ **Live-Linked Comments UI**  
  Comments appear and reorganize based on what’s currently playing in the video.

- 📌 **Visual Anchors for Context (Without Clutter)**  
  Comments are visually attached to moments in the video using minimal, clean UI cues.

- 📱 **Mobile-First Readability & Accessibility**  
  Designed for smaller screens while maintaining readability and visual balance.

- 🕒 **Smart Timestamp Filters**  
  Users can jump between key comment segments that match specific video timestamps.
